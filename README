Adverse Reaction Search App is an API-driven application which allows for interaction with the OpenFDA API. This provides hospitals and health systems an easy way to check in on medical adverse reactions that may affect their inventory. This could be anything from a reconstitution solution to a pain medicine or the combination of these. Searching with filters based upon drug or manufacturer will allow the user to see which combinations have been known to cause reactions in similar scenarios.

In the future - Adverse Reaction Search App will be more advanced to search with more complex queries and include a login functionality to load your hospital "profile". This will be a data set to populate the controls with your inventory and most common searches.
